These functions can be configured to return a custom name, comment and other things to customize your output.</p><p>The hooks are more or less intact as <a href="./postRenderHooks.html">postRenderHooks</a>. Those take a path and an array of strings, allowing you to do crude processing if necessary. However, you will probably prefer to create <a href="./preRenderHooks.html">preRenderHooks</a> that operate on more abstract data models and allow you more flexibility.</p><h2 id="ignoring-entities" tabindex="-1">Ignoring entities <a class="header-anchor" href="#ignoring-entities" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>The <code>schema.ignore</code> property has been replaced by one general <code>typeFilter</code> function which can filter out any table, view or other entity that you don&#39;t want to process.</p><p>If you used to have an ignore property like this:</p><div class="language-"><button class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">ignore: [/^celery/, /^djcelery/],</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span></code></pre></div><p>you could replace it with this:</p><div class="language-"><button class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">typeFilter: d =&gt; ![/^celery/, /^djcelery/].some((v) =&gt; v.test(d.name)),</span></span>

It should now be indexed by <code>schemaName.typeName</code>. For builtin types, this means you specify them as <code>pg_catalog.float8</code> etc. Also, you no longer have to specify array types explicitly as these should be resolved using the same rules as non-array types.</p><h2 id="external-types" tabindex="-1">External types <a class="header-anchor" href="#external-types" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>The <code>externalTypesFolder</code> has been removed. Kanel will now assume that all types that are referenced as a simple string are built-in Typescript types (like <code>string</code>, <code>number</code>, <code>Record&lt;&gt;</code>, etc.). If you want to refer to a type that you created in a different file or that exists in an external package, you need to reference it as a <code>TypeImport</code>. You can do that in tagged comments like this: <code>@type(EmailString, &quot;./models/types/EmailString&quot;, false, true) Email address</code> -- this will import a type called <code>EmailString</code> from a file of the same name in the types folder. It will be imported as a named import.</p>`,16),r=[s];function i(l,c,d,p,h,m){return a(),t("div",null,r)}const g=e(n,[["render",i]]);export{y as __pageData,g as default};
