It is easier if you have a mono-repo setup or at least have the code that relies on these types version controlled together with your migrations.</p><p>The recommended process making an architectural change is:</p><ol><li>Create a database migration using Knex or regular SQL.</li><li>Run the migration on your local development database.</li><li>Run Kanel on your dev database. It will create/update your type definitions.</li><li>Review the new defintions and update your code to support the new architecture.</li><li>When everything works, push and deploy the migration together with the updated type definitions and other changes.</li></ol><p>Introduction to the idea is outlined <a href="https://medium.com/@kristiandupont/generating-typescript-types-from-postgres-48661868ef84" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.</p><h2 id="linting" tabindex="-1">Linting <a class="header-anchor" href="#linting" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Linting&quot;">​</a></h2><p>When using the database as the source of truth, you want to perform your linter checks on the structure of the database, i.e. the schema.
